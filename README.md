### General Overview
(include here description of unit, what class(es) it fits into, when...)

Recommended for Grades 3-5 in a stand alone CS class or integrated into a social studies class and for general education or students with disabilities and neurodiverse learners

Students are introduced to a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. Students learn about data and what types of data is used in A.I. and Machine Learning. Using unplugged activities, students explore labeling data, classifying data, recognizing patterns in data, and explore game-based activities that introduce them to training A.I. bots. We will look into how AI address world problems and how they can use the Problem Solving Process to help.  This can be part of a standalong CS class or integrated into a social studies and CS class that looks at the role of A.I

### Motivation for Unit
(why have you decided to make this?)

Working with students with disabilities has shown how interactive students are with robots.  They tend to interact more with robots than with peers and teachers.  With AI, the possibility can be endless.  Students' learning can grow exponentially.

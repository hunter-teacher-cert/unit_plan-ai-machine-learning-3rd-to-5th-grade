# UNIT PLAN NAME: Impacts of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning OR THE A.I. BOTS in Our Lives

### General Overview
(include here description of unit, what class(es) it fits into, when...)

Recommended for Grades 3-5 in a stand alone CS class or integrated into a social studies class and for general education or students with disabilities and neurodiverse learners.

Students are introduced to a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. Students learn about data and what types of data is used in A.I. and Machine Learning. Using unplugged activities, students explore labeling data, classifying data, recognizing patterns in data, and explore game-based activities that introduce them to training A.I. bots. Students will analyze how A.I. and Machine Learning are programmed to make decisions without direct human input. We will look into how AI address world problems and how the Problem Solving Process is used and they will explore various datasets and how they can be biased and represent only one point of view

This can be part of a standalong CS class or integrated into a social studies and CS class that looks at the role of A.I

### Motivation for Unit
(why have you decided to make this?)

Working with students with disabilities have shown how interactive students are with robots and they have frequently and boisterously expressed their interest in how A.I. technology like Alexa, Google, and Siri work. They often speculate about whether these tools are smarter than humans and some students adamantly say that these A.I. devices are smarter than us. They tend to interact more with robots and these A.I. tools than with peers and teachers.  With AI, the possibility can be endless. Students' learning can grow exponentially. This unit seeks to demystify the mythical perception that students have about these devices and strengthen their understanding of A.I. and Machine Learning.
